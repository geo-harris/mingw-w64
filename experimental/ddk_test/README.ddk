DDK sdk for x86 and x64 platforms.
----------------------------------

You can check for existance of this optional package by verifying
the definition of the macro MINGW_HAVE_DDK_H.

The DDK headers are from the ReactOS project.

This is an optional SDK. Some of the headers are public domain and
some of them are under LGPL license. You can obtain the original
sources from the ReactOS project.

The "ddk" directory is from the ReactOS repo
svn://svn.reactos.org/reactos/trunk/reactos/include/ddk/
... revision 48273.

The individual files
    atsmedia.h,
    compstui.h,
    devioctl.h, devpropdef.h,
    dpfilter.h,
    evntprov.h,
    ktmtypes.h, kcom.h, ksdebug.h, ksuuids.h,
    lmon.h, netevent.h, nettypes.h, newdev.h,
    ntdef.h, ntiologc.h,
    ntddchgr.h, ntddkbd.h, ntddmou.h, ntddstor.h,
    usb100.h, usb200.h, usbcamdi.h, usbdi.h, usb.h,
    usbioctl.h, usbiodef.h, usbrpmif.h, usbuser.h,
    winddi.h, winddiui.h,
    winsplp.h
... are from the ReactOS repo:
svn://svn.reactos.org/reactos/trunk/reactos/include/psdk/
... revision 48239.
They are dependencies of ddk headers. Of them, evntprov.h, ktmtypes.h,
ksuuids.h are already merged back to our main headers as of rev. 2855.

The individual files
    bdamedia.h, bdatypes.h,
... are from the ReactOS repo:
svn://svn.reactos.org/reactos/trunk/reactos/include/dxsdk/
... revision 46880 and 45607 resp.

The bugcodes.mc file is from
svn://svn.reactos.org/reactos/trunk/reactos/include/reactos/mc/
... revision 47897 and it was used for generating the bugcodes.h
header using the wmc tool from wine-1.2-rc5.

How to install this SDK
----------------------------------
Please simply copy the content of the include directory within the
include folder of our header-set. Most of the needed import libraries
are already generated within the crt build, so you shouldn't need
any further compilation.
