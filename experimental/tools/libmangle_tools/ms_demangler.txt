Desctiption

    ms_demangler.c uses UnDecorateSymbolName() from Dbghelp.dll to undecorate
    Visual C++ encoded names into human readable names.
    
    While ms_demangler.c works similarly to libmagle, it will not work 
    under non-Windows platform because of its dependency on Dbghelp.dll.
    
Building ms_demangler.c

    ms_demangler.c requires the use of Microsft's Visual C++ compiler 
    along with a recent version of Platform SDK.

Usaging ms_demangler.c
    
    ms_demangler.c process decorated names passed to it via command-line
    parameters and prints the undecorated names to stdout.
    
    Example Output:
   
    C:\>ms_demangler.exe "??_Fbad_cast@@QAEXXZ" "??3@YAXPAX@Z"

    ms_demangler

    ??_Fbad_cast@@QAEXXZ
    public: void __thiscall bad_cast::`default constructor closure'(void)

    ??3@YAXPAX@Z
    void __cdecl operator delete(void *)

Issues

    ms_demangler.c should work with of any version of Windows with
    dbghelp.dll installed (tested with 5.1.2600.5512).

    A recent version can be found in Microsoft's Debugging Tools for Windows.

UnDecorateSymbolName Documentation

    DWORD WINAPI UnDecorateSymbolName(
      __in   PCTSTR DecoratedName,
      __out  PTSTR UnDecoratedName,
      __in   DWORD UndecoratedLength,
      __in   DWORD Flags
    );

Parameters

    DecoratedName [in]
    The decorated C++ symbol name. This name can be identified by the
    first character of the name, which is always a question mark (?).
    
    UnDecoratedName [out]
    A pointer to a string buffer that receives the undecorated name.
    
    UndecoratedLength [in]
    The size of the UnDecoratedName buffer, in characters.
    
    Flags [in]
    The options for how the decorated name is undecorated. This 
    parameter can be zero or more of the following values. 

    Flag                            Value   Description
    UNDNAME_32_BIT_DECODE           0x0800  Undecorate 32-bit decorated names.
    UNDNAME_COMPLETE                0x0000  Enable full undecoration.
    UNDNAME_NAME_ONLY               0x1000  Crack only the name for primary declaration.Returns [scope::]name. Does expand template parameters.
    UNDNAME_NO_ACCESS_SPECIFIERS    0x0080  Disable expansion of access specifiers for members.
    UNDNAME_NO_ALLOCATION_LANGUAGE  0x0010  Disable expansion of the declaration language specifier.
    UNDNAME_NO_ALLOCATION_MODEL     0x0008  Disable expansion of the declaration model.
    UNDNAME_NO_ARGUMENTS            0x2000  Do not undecorate function arguments.
    UNDNAME_NO_CV_THISTYPE          0x0040  Disable expansion of CodeView modifiers on the this type for primary declaration.
    UNDNAME_NO_FUNCTION_RETURNS     0x0004  Disable expansion of return types for primary declarations.
    UNDNAME_NO_LEADING_UNDERSCORES  0x0001  Remove leading underscores from Microsoft keywords.
    UNDNAME_NO_MEMBER_TYPE          0x0200  Disable expansion of the static or virtual attribute of members.
    UNDNAME_NO_MS_KEYWORDS          0x0002  Disable expansion of Microsoft keywords.
    UNDNAME_NO_MS_THISTYPE          0x0020  Disable expansion of Microsoft keywords on the this type for primary declaration.
    UNDNAME_NO_RETURN_UDT_MODEL     0x0400  Disable expansion of the Microsoft model for user-defined type returns.
    UNDNAME_NO_SPECIAL_SYMS         0x4000  Do not undecorate special names, such as vtable, vcall, vector, metatype, and so on.
    UNDNAME_NO_THISTYPE             0x0060  Disable all modifiers on the this type.
    UNDNAME_NO_THROW_SIGNATURES     0x0100  Disable expansion of throw-signatures for functions and pointers to functions.

Return Value

    If the function succeeds, the return value is the number of characters
    in the UnDecoratedName buffer, not including the NULL terminator.
    
    If the function fails, the return value is zero. To retrieve 
    extended error information, call GetLastError.

    If the function fails and returns zero, the content of the 
    UnDecoratedName buffer is undetermined.
    
Remarks

    To use undecorated symbols, call the SymSetOptions function with 
    the SYMOPT_UNDNAME <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms681366(VS.85).aspx>
    option.

    All DbgHelp functions, such as this one, are single threaded. Therefore, 
    calls from more than one thread to this function will likely result in 
    unexpected behavior or memory corruption. To avoid this, you must synchronize 
    all concurrent calls from more than one thread to this function.

    To call the Unicode version of this function, define DBGHELP_TRANSLATE_TCHAR.

Requirements

    Redistributable         DbgHelp.dll 5.1 or later
    Header                  Dbghelp.h
    Library                 Dbghelp.lib
    DLL                     Dbghelp.dll
    Unicode and ANSI names  UnDecorateSymbolNameW (Unicode) and UnDecorateSymbolName (ANSI)
